Pre Made Server with the base essentials and bug fixes

This server acts as a base for those that want to start a server using VORP Core. This server in its current state provides the bare essentials in a working state with many issues and bugs being remedied. It contains updated icon images, provides means for confident usage of metabolism and other base Vorp scripts. It is purposely created to serve as a working base for others to build from.

Features and Additions:

Other than replacing many icons with the original base game icons, meat types have been defined including game, big game, herptile, bird, and alligator. A rework of the items table in the sql file to correct spelling errors (peasant > pheasant) as well as a description for the majority of existing items (nice item > something more descriptive). A newly formed variable naming convention for both cooked/crafted items and police/medic positions. 

Current State:

Currently, when a new player joins, they have the option to buy basic necessities at all general stores within the county using basic Vorp scripts including bread, water, and a canteen. Canteens are fillable at most pumps and fresh water sources. Bread can serve its purpose of feeding or a player can go hunt and cook plain meats. The naming convention for crafted food is ‘state_item_type’ i.e ‘cooked_venison_plain’. By using this naming convention, the sql table, items folder, and future use e.g ‘cooked_beef_stew_vegtetable’ will become easier and more efficient. Other than basic food and water, the player can buy any guns. It is up to the server owner to make decisions on how to move the server forward. 

The game server presented here is given with the hopes of helping those who wish to use Vorp Core a quicker entry into the world. There are also many community scripts available that have been modified, even slightly, to make their inclusion easier and more streamlined. 

Conclusion:

The overall purpose of this release is to give the community the base resource files and items table to use for their own needs. This is not meant as a plug and play option for a full server, rather a drop in set of files, that will help get the server up and running so a new server owner can focus on additions rather than just getting a base profile.
